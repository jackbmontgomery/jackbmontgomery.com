      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-the-lyapunov-exponent-is-visualise-and-measure-choas-in-the-2d-standard-map&#34;&gt;Using the Lyapunov Exponent is visualise and measure choas in the 2D Standard map&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my fourth year at the University of Cape Town I took a course in Chaos theory. The course had a large computational component which I was very interested in. As the course went on we had more complicated (albeit still not incredibly complicated) simulations to run and my python programs were taking incredibly long to run. I knew faster langauages existed but I did not have the time to learn them in this semester course so I just had a be content with running simulations over night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;autoregressive-rollout-in-jax&#34;&gt;Autoregressive rollout in jax&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Python has a very simple and intuitive syntax that makes the developing time of a project, generally, short. The issue with python is when we start to consider the executive time for projects, especially intentive simulation and modelling jobs. In these scenarios julia or Matlab could be better suited to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons python is slow in these simulation and physics environments is that they requiure extensive control flow. There is lots of looping and conditions which python is not very good at. We will be using &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/index.html&#34;&gt;JAX&lt;/a&gt; in the post today to try an cirucmvent these control flow bottlenecks in python programs. JAX is an open source python package made by Google, provides simple API&amp;rsquo;s and functional transformations to make python more performant while keeping the simple syntax. Specifically, what we will be looking into today is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html&#34;&gt;jax.lax.scan&lt;/a&gt;, which I will call &lt;em&gt;scan&lt;/em&gt; for short.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
