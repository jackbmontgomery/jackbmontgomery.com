# Hello There
I'm a mathematics enthusiast with a strong interest in applied mathematics, particularly in the areas of active inference, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My work focuses on exploring the intersection of theoretical concepts and real-world applications, from predictive coding and reinforcement learning to function approximation and data analysis. Currently, I am pursuing an Honours degree in Mathematics at the University of Cape Town and planning to further my studies with a Master's in Applied Mathematics in the UK. In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy developing software solutions that bridge the gap between theory and practice, leveraging technologies like PyTorch, FastAPI, and Vue.js. Here, you'll find insights into my projects, research, and ongoing explorations in the fascinating world of mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence.
