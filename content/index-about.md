I am a student studying applied mathematics with professional background in software engineering and data science.
I have a wide range of academic interests including, but not limited to, reinforcement learning, dynamical systems, chaos theory, active inference.
This website is a collection of posts I have written on topics I find interesting.
The posts are tutorial-like and you should be able to replicate any results by copying code blocks or downloading the notebooks.
Please reach out if you have any oppotunities or would like to chat about anything academic or professional.
