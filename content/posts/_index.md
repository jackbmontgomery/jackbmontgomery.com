The main reason I created this website is for this section. I love learning and teaching, and these activities are not mutually exclusive. As much as these posts / tutorial / blogs are very much about trying to comminicate ideas to a wide audience, they are also with the itention of learning these concepts on a deeper levels.

I hope you enjoy reading these posts as much as I enjoyed writing them.
